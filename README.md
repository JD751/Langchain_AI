# Project Title

## Description

This project represents an advanced integration system designed to automate the process of generating inspirational content from textual sources, specifically targeting therapy and motivational uses. Utilizing the OpenAI API, it expertly crafts natural language responses from a vast knowledge base, tailored to the therapeutic context of Complex Post-Traumatic Stress Disorder (CPTSD). This innovative approach not only extracts meaningful quotes from PDF documents but also uses those quotes to inspire the creation of unique, nature-themed images through DALL-E, aimed at providing therapeutic value. Furthermore, the framework automates the distribution of these resources by uploading the generated images to AWS S3 and employing webhooks for efficient notification and sharing. This project is an exemplary model of how AI can be harnessed to support mental health initiatives, offering a tool for therapists, motivational speakers, and individuals seeking self-help methods to access and share uplifting content.

The utility of this project lies in its ability to seamlessly bridge the gap between text-based therapy content and visual inspiration. By automating the extraction, processing, and visual representation of therapeutic advice, it significantly enhances the accessibility and distribution of motivational resources. This system is particularly valuable for professionals in mental health and motivational speaking, enabling them to enrich their resources with AI-generated content that's both engaging and supportive. Additionally, for individuals seeking personal growth or coping strategies, this project offers a unique source of inspiration and comfort, directly at their fingertips.

## Features

- Integration with OpenAI's API for natural language processing.
- PDF text extraction and processing.
- Generation of images based on textual inputs using DALL-E.
- Uploading images to AWS S3.
- Use of webhooks for notifications.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Install the required Python packages:

    ```bash
    pip install python-dotenv pdfplumber requests boto3 PIL
    ```

3. Ensure you have API keys for OpenAI and AWS credentials set up in your environment variables.

## Usage

- Load your OpenAI and AWS credentials into environment variables.
- Run the script to process the PDF, generate a quote, create an image based on the quote, upload the image to AWS S3, and notify a webhook.

## Code Structure

- The code is organized into sections for initializing the OpenAI language model, processing PDF files, generating images, and uploading to AWS S3.
- Exception handling is implemented for robust operation.

## Dependencies

- `python-dotenv`: To load environment variables.
- `pdfplumber`: For PDF text extraction.
- `requests`: For making HTTP requests.
- `PIL`: For image processing.
